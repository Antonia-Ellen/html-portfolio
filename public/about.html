<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In 2015, I began my journey in the world of technology with a technical course in programming at IFPI. Although I didn't find an internship opportunity at the time and spent some time working in telemarketing, my passion for programming never faded.
</p>  

<p>The pursuit of knowledge motivated me to resume my studies in 2024, when I began a higher education course, driven by the constant growth and evolution of the technology field. Now, more than ever, I am determined to **improve my skills** and **apply the knowledge I have acquired in practice**.
</p>

<p>I am seeking an opportunity to **contribute with my dedication and continuous learning** in an environment that allows me to grow professionally and be part of the future of technology.
